## Classes and Objects -

<b>Objects :</b> Objects are `entities` in the real world.

<b>Classes :</b> Class is like a `blueprint` of these entities

<b>e.g. -</b> A car company makes blueprint (Class). And with those blueprints a lot of cars (Object) are made.

## Access Modifiers -

- <b>Private :</b>  data & methods accesible inside class (by default everything is private in C++)

- <b>Public :</b>  data & methods accesible to everyone

- <b>Protected :</b>  data & methods accesible inside & to its derived classes

## Encapsulation -

Encapsulation is `wrapping up` of data and member functions into a single unit called class.

(emphasysis on capsule word)

Basically humne data/properties ko member function ke sath wrap kar diya and usko class ke andar rakh diya and iss process ko encapsulation kehte hain.

Help in `data hiding` through access modifiers.

## Constructor -

Special method invoked automatically at the time of `object creation`. Used for Initialization.

- Same name as class.
- Constructor doesn't have return type.
- Only called once (automatically) at the time of object creation.
- Memory allocation happens when constructor is called.
